        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare pie crust. Separate into two dough balls, wrap in plastic, and place in the fridge to rest.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees</li>
            <li>Peel and core apples. Slice apples (about 1/4" slices.</li>
            <li>Place apple slices in a large bowl and squeeze juice from half a lemon over them.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the sugar, flour, spices, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add dry mix to the apples. If the apples are too wet, add a little more flour</li>
            <li>Roll out half the pie crust big enough to line a 9in pie plate. Line the dish and then fill it with the apple mixture.</li>
            <li>Dot the apples with small pieces of butter.</li>
            <li>Roll out the second half of the pie crust. Cover the pie, trim the excess, and crimp the edges with a fork to seal.</li>
            <li>Cut steam vents on the top. Add any decorations you'd like to make from the excess crust.</li>
            <li>Brush the top of the pastry crust with melted butter. Sprinkle a little sugar on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the pie crust with a pie shield or aluminum foil to protect the edges. Cook pie in preheated oven for 50 mins. Insert a cake tester through the steam vents to feel if the apples are tender.</li>
            <li>Before serving pie, reheat in a warm oven. Serve with ice cream if you want to!</li>
        </ol>
